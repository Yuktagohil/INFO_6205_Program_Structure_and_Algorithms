    "A. The vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem is not in P. To prove this, we will show that the problem is NP-hard. We will do this by reducing the Hamiltonian cycle problem to the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem.\n",

    "The Hamiltonian cycle problem is the problem of determining whether a given undirected graph G has a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is known to be NP-complete.\n",

    "If G has a Hamiltonian cycle C, then we can construct a vertex-disjoint cycle-cover of G' by taking the following cycles:\n",

    "+ For each edge e ∈ C, we take the cycle that consists of e and its two neighbors in G'.<br>\n",

    "For the first check, we can simply count the number of edges in each cycle.<br>\n",
